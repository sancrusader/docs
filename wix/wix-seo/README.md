## Before starting seo consider

1. Who are your potential customers?
2. What is your uniqeu value proposition?
3. What are your competitors doing?

## What’s this business's or brand's name?

This name will be added to the SEO checklist so you’ll know where this info needs to be included. Make sure to keep the name as it’s currently written on the site because having consistent site content is important for SEO.

```
Business name
```

## **Which keywords do you want to use in this site's checklist?**

Keywords are phrases (usually 2-5 words long) that help match your site to what customers enter into search engines. They should describe your business and what it offers, such as “online vintage comic book store.”

* Don’t include your business or site name.
* Use descriptive words, like “vintage comic book store” instead of “book store.”

**Good examples**:

`online mystery book store` `comic book delivery shop` `spiderman comic subscription box`

**Bad examples:**

&#x20;`book store` `order second hand comic book online for teenagers age 14` `jane’s book store`
