Wix is a cloud-based web development platform that enables users to create HTML5 websites and mobile sites through the use of online drag-and-drop tools. It was founded in 2006 by Avishai Abrahami, Nadav Abrahami, and Giora Kaplan. Wix provides a range of customizable templates for different types of websites, from e-commerce stores to personal blogs. Users can easily add features such as social media integration, e-commerce functionality, and contact forms without needing to know how to code.

One of the key features of Wix is its intuitive drag-and-drop editor, which allows users to easily design their websites by simply dragging elements such as text boxes, images, and buttons onto the page and arranging them as desired. Additionally, Wix offers a variety of third-party apps through its App Market, allowing users to further customize and enhance their websites with additional features and functionality.

Wix also provides hosting services, meaning that users can publish their websites directly through the platform. The company offers both free and premium subscription plans, with the premium plans unlocking additional features such as custom domain names, increased storage and bandwidth, and removal of Wix ads from the site. Overall, Wix is a popular choice for individuals and small businesses looking to create professional-looking websites without the need for technical expertise.
