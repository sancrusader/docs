# Introduction

A **WebSocket** is a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex (two-way) channel between a web browser (or other client) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, where a client requests data from the server and the server responds, WebSockets allow data to be sent and received in real time from both sides without needing to constantly open and close new connections.

This makes WebSockets ideal for applications that require fast, interactive communication such as chat apps, live data feeds, multiplayer games, and real-time collaboration tools. The WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP request, and after a successful handshake, it switches to the WebSocket protocol, allowing efficient and low-latency data exchange.
